# The norepi.org Robots Exclusion Standard (colloq. robots.txt).
#
# See <robotstxt.org> for an informal robots.txt specification.

# In general, non-human hosts are permitted to interact with norepi.org unless they are grossly
# impolite or downright malicious.
#
# As a rule of thumb:
# - GET /robots.txt before doing anything else.
# - Wait a few milliseconds before sending your next request.
# - Don't probe for software vulnerabilities, even if you plan to responsibly disclose them. I have
#   no way of knowing your intentions, and you will probably be banned indefinitely.

User-agent: *
# This is a honeypot for malicious robots that scrape robots.txt to find interesting URIs.
#
# Do not access this resource. As the URI warns, you may be banned.
Disallow: /you-may-be-banned-if-you-access-this-resource
# Everything else is fair game.
